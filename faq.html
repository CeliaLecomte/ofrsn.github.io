			<h1 id="aboutepidemium">ABOUT EPIDEMIUM</h1>

			<h2 id="whatrocheintendstodowiththeprogramepidemium">What Roche intends to do with the program Epidemium ?</h2>

			<p>With Epidemium, Roche and La Paillasse explore new paths to cancer research. As an actor in health innovation, our ambition is to reinvent a new form of cancer epidemiology, making it a real tool for predictive and preventive medicine. The study of open data is an exciting field of research as it has never been explored before for cancer.</p>

			<h1 id="participate">ABOUT PARTICIPATING</h1>

			<h2 id="whocanparticipatetothechallenge4cancer">Who can participate to the Challenge4Cancer ?</h2>

			<p>The C4C is open to all, whatever your area of competence, your skills and your level of expertise. It is from the heterogeneity of the profiles that the best ideas can emerge! Beyond data scientists or researchers, here is an example of the fields of competence that are interesting in order to design and develop projects: design, law, sociology, climatology, etc. Everyone can join the Challenge4Cancer and make a difference!</p>

			<h2 id="howtoregister">How to register ?</h2>

			<p>To participate in the C4C, it is essential to register on the Epidemium platform in order to be recognized as a participant and a member of a team. For this, several possibilities:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>My team is already formed in part or totally, with or without a defined project: we register all together.</li>

			<li>I do not have a team but I want to participate, with or without a defined project: I register.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="howlongisitpossibletoregister">How long is it possible to register ?</h2>

			<p>Registrations are open until the end of the Challenge4Cancer, that is to say until december 5 2017. Nevertheless, we advise you to register as early as possible in order to discover the synergy around the different projects and beneficiate from it. Nothing prevents you from working on your side and revealing your project only at the end but you will then miss the strength of Epidemium: a community approach to science based on sharing ideas, skills, results in order to open up new perspectives.</p>

			<h2 id="howdoisignup">How do I sign up?</h2>

			<p>To register, it's simple: simply fill out this form.</p>

			<h2 id="ihaveaprojectbutnoteamwhatcanido">I have a project but no team, what can I do?</h2>

			<p>Sign up and submit your idea to the Epidemium community! The platform will help you to find other participants searching for a team to be part of and the skills needed to carry out your project.
			If at first you want to remain anonymous, you can send your project idea to the Epidemium team, which will take it to the community. Depending on the feedback of the other participants and the validation of your idea, you will then be able to start the project with one other!</p>

			<h2 id="iwanttoparticipatebutihavenoprojectideaisitpossible">I want to participate but i have no project idea, is it possible?</h2>

			<p>Yes, register now! The platform and the events are there to connect the participants. By discovering online projects, you will certainly find a topic that interests you and a team to take part in. And if it is not the case today, you can start by participating in open discussions about the ideas of other participants. To many, you will surely find inspiration.</p>

			<h2 id="ihaveaprojectideathatdoesnotfitintoanyofthechallenge4cancerstopicswhatcanido">I have a project idea that does not fit into any of the Challenge4Cancer’s topics. What can i do?</h2>

			<p>You can submit it to the Epidemium team or directly to the community to discuss and see if it is really not possible to integrate it with any of the existing topics. Themes being broad enough, you should be able to find a way to insert yourself. Even if it means reformulating your project with the help of the community.</p>

			<h2 id="ihaveaprojectideabutidontwantorfeelabletobetheprojectholderortheteamleader">I have a project idea but I don’t want or feel able to be the project holder or the team leader?</h2>

			<p>Offer it to the other participants! You will definitely find other people to help you.</p>

			<h2 id="howmanypeopleshouldcontainateam">How many people should contain a team?</h2>

			<p>There is no constraint on the formation of teams. The number of participants will evolve over time, with some people joining the project when others may leave the team for a variety of reasons.</p>

			<h2 id="idonotliveinpariseveninfrancecaniregisteranyway">I do not live in Paris, even in France, can I register anyway?</h2>

			<p>Of course! Wherever you are, C4C resources and information are available to you. For practical reasons, the majority of organized events (such as Meet-ups) are held in Paris, but other events are and will be organized elsewhere, and we always produce a report and a video of the meet-ups freely accessible. Most importantly, work on projects is done online using the platform and the Wiki. You can therefore actively participate in a project and discuss with other participant, even if you are geographically on the other side of the world (online tools are planed for it)!</p>

			<h2 id="howlongwillittaketoparticipate">How long will it take to participate?</h2>

			<p>Simply as long as you can or will devote to it. Again, there is no constraint: you choose your level of involvement in the program either by actively participating in a project team, by contributing from time to time, or by helping other participants to refine their ideas by exchanging with them. No strain attached!</p>

			<h2 id="iwanttoparticipatebuticannotgetinvolveduntiltheend">I want to participate but I can not get involved until the end?</h2>

			<p>No problem! You can choose your level of engagement and, for example, make only one-time contributions or help with some microtask. If you do not have the opportunity to continue or contribute to your project, others will take over.</p>

			<h2 id="idontknowanythingaboutdatascienceorcomputingsciencecaniregisteranyway">I don’t know anything about data science or computing science, can I register anyway?</h2>

			<p>It's even a reason to register! The Challenge4Cancer, although based on the Open Big Data, does not only require computer skills. Know-how in medicine, human and social sciences, design, etc., are essential to meet the complexity of the challenges and also to build up pertinent assertions, hypothesis and results from the data. The heterogeneity of the skills used and the diversity of points of view will be the key to develop the best projects. In addition, the C4C is a good opportunity to discover a new field and to start training on subjects that are for the moment totally unknown to you. The event and the community are here for that!</p>

			<h2 id="idontknowanythingaboutresearchbiologyoroncologycaniregisteranyway">I don’t know anything about research, biology or oncology, can I register anyway?</h2>

			<p>The same applies to the previous question: the Challenges do not call for a particular competence but rather for multiple expertise. Other participants with whom you can build a team, Epidemium experts, committees, will be able to guide you and complete your expertise. Therefore the events organized by Epidemium are conceived in order to give you some insights on medical question and the opportunity to discuss with the medical community.</p>

			<h2 id="howtocontacttheepidemiumecosystemexpertscommitteemembers">How to contact the Epidemium ecosystem (experts, committee members)?</h2>

			<p>To contact the experts or the members of the independent ethics and scientific committees, several e-mails are available (contact@epidemium.cc, ethic@epidemium.cc, methodologie@epidemium.cc). The Epidemium team, for practical reasons, is the intermediary and will pass your questions to the right people.</p>

			<h2 id="idonotwanteveryonetoseemywork">I do not want everyone to see my work?</h2>

			<p>Although we encourage public documentation of projects on the Wiki and their referencing on the platform, they are not obligation. Nothing prevents you from working on your side and to reveal your project only at the end, which is obligatory, Epidemium being an open science program. But, by doing so, you will miss the strength of Epidemium: a community-based approach to science and a sharing of ideas and skills to open up new perspectives. Making a project public is simply a good way to confront it with external opinions and evaluate it as the C4C progress. You will be able to find out who will join the project and identify the missing skills in order to upgrade your projects. </p>

			<h1 id="aboutthedata">About the data</h1>

			<h2 id="iwouldliketoproposeanewdatasetisitpossible">I would like to propose a new dataset, is it possible?</h2>

			<p>If you wish, you can submit a new data set. It only needs to be open to everyone so that everyone can benefit from it freely. If you submit a dataset to us, we will validate it first in the organizing team and send it to the scientific and independent ethics committees for their agreement, as was the case for all the data sets proposed in the Challenge today.</p>

			<h2 id="whydoesthechallengenotusegenomicdata">Why does the challenge not use genomic data?</h2>

			<p>To the extent that the challenge relates to the epidemiological determinants of cancer, Epidemium have to work on data of "population size". Of course, this would be possible within a genomic framework but the size of the genomic samples now available in open data makes it difficult to access omic epidemiology in large populations. But, given the dynamics of Open Data in health, this should happen in the near future.</p>
